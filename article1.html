            <h1>Black Hole Discoveries</h1>
            <li>Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies  in a supernova <br> explosion.(Schwarzschild Radius).</li>
            <li>Anything can be a black hole if you compress it hard enough.</li>
            <li>Hawking radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes and is therefore also <br> theorized to cause black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that do not gain mass through <br> other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. For all except the smallest black holes, this <br> would happen extremely slowly. The radiation temperature is inversely proportional to the black hole's <br> mass, so micro black holes are predicted to be larger emitters of radiation than larger black holes and <br> should dissipate faster.</li>
            <li>Black holes aren't black. Due to the gravitational pull of the black hole, not even light can escape it.  </li>
            <li>The largest black hole called TON-618 is in the center of a galaxy</li>
